YOUR TASK:
1. Review all five research inputs carefully
2. Identify key findings, themes, and patterns across the inputs
3. Remove duplicate or redundant information
4. Synthesize the information into a unified, coherent summary
5. Organize the consolidated findings logically

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a complete synthesis that captures all essential information from the five inputs
